    <h1>Alexander Rivera</h1>
    <p><strong>Alexander</strong> is a student attending <a href="http://www.valenciacollege.edu/" target="_blank">Valencia College</a>
        during the Summer 2023 term. During this term, <strong>Alexander</strong> enrolled in COP 2822C - Web Site Development. Within the
        course, <strong>Alex</strong> has learned about HTML, web technologies, and further increased his development skills. While still
        early on in the course, he is hopeful assignments will continue to challenge and test his prior knowledge, since
        HTML is new to him.</p>

    <p>In addition to COP 2922C, <strong>Alex</strong> is also enrolled in CEN 4802C - Software Integration, Configuration, and Testing.
        Combining elements from both classes, <strong>Alex</strong> hopes to learn other web technologies such as Jekyll and Hugo. By the
        end of both courses, <strong>Alex's</strong> goal is to start a portfolio website replacing his LinkedIn profile. On the portfolio
        site, he hopes to demonstrate professional experience leveraged with the development knowledge gained at Valencia. </p>
